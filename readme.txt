This tool allows you to draw label-regular trees.

A generating matrix is used to define the how many neighbours of each
category each node has.  For example, with the matrix

2 1 3
1 1 1
1 1 4

and categories 'red', 'green' and 'blue', each red node has two red
neighbours, one green neighbour and three blue neighbours (reading
across the top row).  Each green node has one neighbour of each
colour, and each blue neighbour has one red and one green
neighbour and four blue neighbours.

Edit the colours to your liking, and turn on and off various
decorations such as node outlines, edges and fading of leaf
nodes.
